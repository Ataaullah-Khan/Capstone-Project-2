# **A Simple Game**


*The player can move up and down left and right with the arrow keys and must avoid colliding with the ‘enemy’ to win.*
*The game includes:*

1. One player object.
2. Three enemy objects that move across the screen from different positions. Clooding with an enemy results in a loss.
3. One prize object. If the player object collides with the prize object, they win, and the game ends.
